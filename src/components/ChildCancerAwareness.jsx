                Adults can observe the signs and symptoms of cancer in their
                bodies and maybe take some action however, in children, it is
                difficult to understand and observe any signs and symptoms under
                all the regular play accidents, bruises or any common illnesses.
                It is difficult to detect cancer in children as they are rare
                compared to adults.

              <p>
                There are many types of childhood cancers and they are quite
                different from the adult cancers. Adult cancers majorly
                originate in organs whereas childhood cancer involves tissues
                (hematopoietic, lymphatic, central nervous system, muscle , bone
                etc).
              </p>
              <p>
                Awareness about the signs and symptoms is necessary for early
                diagnosis, in India majority of the cases presenting to the
                oncology centres come at late stages where dissemination has
                already occurred.
