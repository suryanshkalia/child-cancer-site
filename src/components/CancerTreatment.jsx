            <p>
              There are many types of cancer treatment. The types of treatment
              that you receive will depend on the type of cancer you have and
              how advanced it is.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some people with cancer will have only one treatment. But most
              people have a combination of treatments, such as surgery with
              chemotherapy and radiation therapy. When you need treatment for
              cancer, you have a lot to learn and think about. It is normal to
              feel overwhelmed and confused. But, talking with your doctor and
              learning about the types of treatment you may have can help you
              feel more in control.
